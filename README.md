# 🎭 Analyzing *The Office* with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to explore the script of a single episode of *The Office*. By analyzing line-level text data, we uncover the most active characters, frequent words, sentiment-heavy terms, and visual patterns in dialogue.

## 🔍 Objective
To apply NLP techniques — including tokenization, stopword filtering, bigrams, sentiment analysis, and word cloud visualization — on a transcript from *The Office* to extract linguistic and character-driven insights.

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Techniques
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal)
- Unigrams & Bigrams
- Word frequency analysis
- Word cloud generation
- Sentiment analysis (positive vs. negative contributions)
- Visualizations using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `wordcloud`

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: A dataset of *The Office* transcripts (season & episode filtered)
- Fields used: `line_text`, `speaker`

## 📈 Sample Insights
- Top 10 most vocal characters in the selected episode
- Common word patterns before and after stopword removal
- Top bigrams (frequent two-word combos)
- Sentiment-heavy words (positive vs. negative)
- Word cloud summarizing the dialogue

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files
- `office_episode_nlp.ipynb`: Full notebook with analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview and methodology

## 🤔 Why This Project?
Analyzing script data from TV shows opens the door to understanding how characters interact, what emotional tone drives scenes, and how language evolves episode to episode. This is a fun, creative way to apply core NLP skills on real-world entertainment data.
